My name is Vito Scaletta.
I was born in Sicily in '97. 
This is our family. 
I’m standing with my parents and sister Francesca. 
I don't remember much about those times, except that life was hard and then my father decided it was time for us to leave. 
Leave Sicily, cross the ocean and start a new life in Ukraine. 
Never in my life have I seen anything like Ushhorod.
